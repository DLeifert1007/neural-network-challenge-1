# neural-network-challenge-1
I am working at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. My team and I have been asked to create a model to predict student loan repayment.

The business team has given me a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.

*Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

*Compile and evaluate a model using a neural network.

*Predict loan repayment success by using your neural network model.

*Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans.

**Question 1**

Here I will describe the data that should be collected to build a recommendation system for student loan options.

This is why I think that data should be collected. 

The type of data described is appropriate for a recommendation system for student loan options.

**Question 2**

The filtering method that I chose is...

To justified the choice of the filtering method I can...

The choice of filtering method was appropriate for the data selected in the previous question. 

**Question**

Two real-world challenges with building a recommendation system for student loans are...

These challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system because...
